# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: Wednesday - May 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

1. Implement a simple state mechanism in C++ to control built-in Arduino LED via serial port, using PlatformIO as build tool and CLion as IDE. (11:13 - 12:53, 1 hour 39 minutes)

2. Use C# with JSON.Net and the Rider IDE to make a HTTP request to mockapi.io and parse the JSON, using both dynamic and structured method. (1 hour; 15:30 - 16:00 and 17:20 - 17:48)

3. Use Lombok and Kotlin's Gradle DSL in IntelliJ IDEA to reduce Java's boilerplates. (16:20 - 17:19, 59 minutes 11 seconds)

**Thoughts**:

- C# and .NET Core is pretty easy to work with.

- C++ is not that difficult; pretty sweet actually! Gotta try doing more hardware stuff with C++ and ESP32/ESP8266 boards soon. (and buy more stuff, heheh)

- Lombok is a lifesaver when working with Java.

- Gotta try Kotlin and its Gradle DSL more. Kotlin seems like a super nice language to work with; not as fancy as Scala tho.

- JetBrains' IDE is a godsend!
