# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Wednesday - May 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

1. Implement a simple state mechanism in C++ to control built-in Arduino LED via serial port, using PlatformIO as build tool and CLion as IDE. (11:13 - 12:53, 1 hour 39 minutes)

2. Use C# with JSON.Net and the Rider IDE to make a HTTP request to mockapi.io and parse the JSON, using both dynamic and structured method. (1 hour; 15:30 - 16:00 and 17:20 - 17:48)

3. Use Lombok and Kotlin's Gradle DSL in IntelliJ IDEA to reduce Java's boilerplates. (16:20 - 17:19, 59 minutes 11 seconds)

**Thoughts**:

- C# and .NET Core is pretty easy to work with.

- C++ is not that difficult; pretty sweet actually! Gotta try doing more hardware stuff with C++ and ESP32/ESP8266 boards soon. (and buy more stuff, heheh)

- Lombok is a lifesaver when working with Java.

- Gotta try Kotlin and its Gradle DSL more. Kotlin seems like a super nice language to work with; not as fancy as Scala tho.

- JetBrains' IDE is a godsend!

## Day 2: Thursday - May 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

1. Updated this **#100DaysOfCode** repository, and wrote my first log for yesterday 📙

2. Initialized EventDuty Repository on GitHub using Parcel and React, and put it on Netlify and updated Cloudflare DNS record. 🌤️

3. Updated README.md on my Git Garden project (Wording changes from the PRs that I received from @Ryan-Willpower) 📝

**Thoughts**:

We're off to a great start! 💖

Today is more of a planning day, so I got 4 cool ideas that I'll be working on 💡

- https://terminaldaily.com - Terminal tips and tricks that makes your life 3000 times better, served hot and fresh everyday. (Bought the domain!)

- https://gitgarden.io/100daysofcode (Git Garden Challenge)

  - Will create a challenge page to display the progress of #100DaysOfCode participants to see how far they've come.

  - Will make some updates to core Git Garden as well; might post it on Reddit or Product Hunt soon?

- https://duty.phoom.in.th (EventDuty) - Duty Manager for Event and Camp Staffs using the MC/OD method. You can view your queue and make changes to the duty on-the-fly.

- https://chill.phoom.in.th - Helps people in my "Teach 'n Chill" community project to create their own study groups for the topics they wanted to learn, and everyone can join or volunteer to be a teacher for that group.

There'll be more algorithm and data structure-oriented learning and teaching projects coming soon too 😉

## Day 3: Friday - May 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

Taught middle-schoolers introduction to Python, C, Flask, Linux, Cloud Infrastructure, MATT, CoLab and GPIO for their IoT Project 🎄

**Thoughts**:

Project-based learning is super fun when the students are really into it! Gotta wrote even more code tomorrow! https://twitter.com/phoomparin/status/1129418193989033984/photo/1

## Day 4: Saturday - May 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

Introduced IoT programming to middle-schoolers! Getting their hands dirty with Python, C, MQTT, GPIO, Raspberry Pi, Arduino and a bunch of sensors and switches 🤖

They ended up installing linux distros (eOS & Mint) on their laptop afterwards! 🦄 https://twitter.com/phoomparin/status/1129688875670986754/video/1

**Thoughts**:

It's the most fun class I've ever taught!

This time, I try out project-based learning: I asked what projects they wanted to make,
what are the features and components, and what do they want to know in order to
accomplish that project.

The entirety of the class is entirely based on their interests, no preparations needed.

I think PBL encourages a TON of discussion; we've talked and shared a lot of things,
much more than what normal classes ever could. I'll always use PBL from now on
in classes smaller than 6 students.

Most of today's classes are about Linux Fundamentals and Python for IoT; We've tried out
Flask, GPIO, MQTT, as well as CLI tools like netcat, ipython, vscode and tmux.

In our discussion, we've discussed why mathematics are important with Shadertoy, how interplanetary engineering work with the AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) Simulator...

The coolest thing is after I've told them about Linux, they went back home and installed linux distros (Mint and eOS), and I'm super happy!

## Day 5: Sunday - May 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

1. Wrote a web-app to help event organizers manage their current queues and time-slots for using React and TypeScript 🏕️

> I wrote a time-slot system and queue display in my EventDuty project with React, Parcel and TypeScript, which helps organizers to manage their events and camps more smoothly.

2. Built a sample app using Flutter to list food menus in Maid Cafes to teach my intro to Flutter class 👧🏻

> Today, we've used the Maidreamin Maid Cafe API to list their food menus via Flutter in my Flutter 101 class, the third class of my "Teach 'n Chill" community project.

**Thoughts**:

I've found out that I tend to experiment a lot in Quokka playgrounds to test if my code-ideas would work out. I think if I made those "experiments" become Unit Tests, I'd be able to experiment much faster while easily ensuring that our business logic does not break down.

While I'm teaching Flutter, I found out lots of issues related to Windows on the students' machine to the point that it is horrendously unbearable. Environment Variable breaks down, Android Emulator crashes, unsuccessful ADB connections, program crashes and lots of weird stuff. I'll have to restrict students to use either Linux or macOS only next time...
