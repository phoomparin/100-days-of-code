# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: Wednesday - May 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

1. Implement a simple state mechanism in C++ to control built-in Arduino LED via serial port, using PlatformIO as build tool and CLion as IDE. (11:13 - 12:53, 1 hour 39 minutes)

2. Use C# with JSON.Net and the Rider IDE to make a HTTP request to mockapi.io and parse the JSON, using both dynamic and structured method. (1 hour; 15:30 - 16:00 and 17:20 - 17:48)

3. Use Lombok and Kotlin's Gradle DSL in IntelliJ IDEA to reduce Java's boilerplates. (16:20 - 17:19, 59 minutes 11 seconds)

**Thoughts**:

- C# and .NET Core is pretty easy to work with.

- C++ is not that difficult; pretty sweet actually! Gotta try doing more hardware stuff with C++ and ESP32/ESP8266 boards soon. (and buy more stuff, heheh)

- Lombok is a lifesaver when working with Java.

- Gotta try Kotlin and its Gradle DSL more. Kotlin seems like a super nice language to work with; not as fancy as Scala tho.

- JetBrains' IDE is a godsend!

## Day 1: Thursday - May 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

1. Updated this **#100DaysOfCode** repository, and wrote my first log for yesterday üìô

2. Initialized EventDuty Repository on GitHub using Parcel and React, and put it on Netlify and updated Cloudflare DNS record. üå§Ô∏è

3. Updated README.md on my Git Garden project (Wording changes from the PRs that I received from @Ryan-Willpower) üìù

**Thoughts**:

We're off to a great start! üíñ

Today is more of a planning day, so I got 4 cool ideas that I'll be working on üí°

- https://terminaldaily.com - Terminal tips and tricks that makes your life 3000 times better, served hot and fresh everyday. (Bought the domain!)

- https://gitgarden.io/100daysofcode (Git Garden Challenge)

  - Will create a challenge page to display the progress of #100DaysOfCode participants to see how far they've come.

  - Will make some updates to core Git Garden as well; might post it on Reddit or Product Hunt soon?

- https://duty.phoom.in.th (EventDuty) - Duty Manager for Event and Camp Staffs using the MC/OD method. You can view your queue and make changes to the duty on-the-fly.

- https://chill.phoom.in.th - Helps people in my "Teach 'n Chill" community project to create their own study groups for the topics they wanted to learn, and everyone can join or volunteer to be a teacher for that group.

There'll be more algorithm and data structure-oriented learning and teaching projects coming soon too üòâ
